# degraded fake RAID on boot
If / becomes degraded the system may not boot without first repairing
the issue. To reboot you'll need to edit GRUB:
1. Edit the kernel line from the GRUB menu
    a) Remove references to dmraid devices (e.g. change /dev/mapper/raidSet1 to /dev/sda1)
    b) Append disablehooks=dmraid to prevent a kernel panic when dmraid
       discovers the degraded array
2. Boot the system
