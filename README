Scripts and things.

Feel free to use these for whatever use, the license
is MIT and can be found in this directory (Unless I
am not the original author).

Files ending with .txt are collections of commands
about the filename, e.g. ssl.txt has useful commands
for SSL related activities.

Most of these require various utilities to be installed
(e.g. Perl) so open a script before you run it to make
sure you have everything you need.
